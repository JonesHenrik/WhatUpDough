# WhatUp Dough!

WhatUp Dough! is a random restaurant generator designed for users who are new to the downtown Detroit area and are interested in exploring diverse cuisines from family-owned small businesses.

# Background

WhatUp Dough! was developed as a single-screen app as part of the curriculum at the Apple Developer Academy. Leveraging SwiftUI, Swift, and the Xcode IDE, we aimed to create an intuitive and engaging experience for users seeking culinary adventures in Detroit.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

WhatUp Dough! provided us with the opportunity to deepen our understanding of SwiftUI and its view encapsulation principles. By leveraging SwiftUI's declarative syntax, we crafted robust and reusable views for the app's ContentView, enhancing code efficiency and maintainability.

Developing an app that deals with multiple restaurants necessitated proficient utilization of types. Through practice, we refined our skills in type creation, allowing us to encapsulate data and behavior into reusable components. This approach facilitated code organization, clarity, and scalability.
